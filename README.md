# wordle-bot
A bot that plays wordle

`available_remaining.py` is a version that just tells you all of the remaining words that are possible.  

`bot.py` is a better version that tells you the best word to guess in terms of expected remaining number of guesses. Inspired by [this](https://ben.land/post/2022/02/11/optimal-wordle-solution/) and fixed some bugs relating to double letters.

# usage
1. download the code
2. cd to the directory
3. download the requirements (ex: `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. run the file (ex: `python bot.py`)
4. follow the instructions
