# wordle-bot
A bot that plays wordle

wordle_bot.py is a version that just tells you all of the remaining words that are possible.  

wordle_better.py is a better version that tells you the best word to guess in terms of expected remaining number of guesses. Copied from [here](https://ben.land/post/2022/02/11/optimal-wordle-solution/) and fixed some bugs relating to double letters.
